Picotm is a system-level transaction manager. It provides transactional
semantics for low-level and operating-system functionality. It's flexible
and extensible to cover exactly your requirements. **Error handling** and
**thread isolation** are provided by picotm, all you have to implement is
the application logic.

Picotm is implemented in plain C and is well-suited for implementing
applications and firmware that is secure, reliable and thread-safe; yet
easy to develop. This makes picotm well-suited for **multi-threaded**
and **fault-tolerant** software.

Picotm is Open Source under terms of the the
[Mozilla Public License, v.2.0][mpl_2_0]; viable for
free and proprietary software.

[Free and commercial support][support] is available.
