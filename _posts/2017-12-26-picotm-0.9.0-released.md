Version 0.9.0 of picotm has been released today. Includes support
for Windows, MacOS X and FreeBSD; and feature-test macros for supported
system interfaces.

<!-- excerpt -->

Here's a full list of new features and bug fixes.

 - Added support for MacOS X, Windows and FreeBSD. Picotm now supports
   MacOS X and FreeBSD natively. Windows is supported through the Cygwin
   compatibility layer.
 - Added feature-test macros. Presence of transactional interfaces for
   system libraries is now announce at build time by C pre-processor macros.
   Test for `PICOTM_<module>_HAVE_<interface>` to be defined to 1.
 - Added test cases for math functions. All functions in the libm module
   now have at least one test case.
 - Bug fix: Don't free alloca()-allocated memory. (#173)
 - Bug fix: Decode 'mode_t' as int when used in varargs. (#182)
 - Bug fix: Don't roll-back twice during recovery. (#208)
 - Bug fix: Don't roll-back when saving FPU exception flags. (#212)
