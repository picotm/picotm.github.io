No Free Software or Open Source project is complete without a mascot
representing it in public, at conferences, or on external web sites. Going
through a long list of candidates, from *A* as in *albatross* to *Z* as
in *zebra,* one candidate out-performed them all. Without further ado,
here's Cate.

<!-- excerpt -->

Cate is a cat (lat: *Failis resolvestris catus*). Like all cats, she's an
excellent hacker. She especially knows how to program her owner to open doors
or food cans for her.

Cate cares about transactional execution. She's an expert in error handling:
Cate has nine lives and always lands on her paws. She also likes
multi-threading: the more threads, the better; especially if they are made of
wool.

Welcome, Cate!

*Cate was designed and drawn by Zs&oacute;fia Sziksz&oacute; of
[eloquium GmbH][eloquium]. Thanks to Ms. Sziksz&oacute; for her work on
the mascot.*
