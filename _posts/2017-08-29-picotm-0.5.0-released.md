Version 0.5.0 of picotm has been released today.

<!-- excerpt -->

Here's a list of new features and bug fixes.

  - Library versioning is now supported by libpicotm.so and its modules.
  - Improved internal error handling. All calls to abort() have been
    replaced with (non-)recoverable error handling; resulting in better
    support for fail-safe systems.
  - File-descriptor support has been reworked and cleaned up. There are
    now seprarate data structures for different file types and open file
    descriptions. Non-transactional corner cases are detected and reported.
  - A data structure for shared reference-counted objects has been added
    to the module library.
  - The GNU and POSIX variants of strerror_r() are now supported.

picotm 0.5.0 is available for download on the GitHub
[release page][picotm_0_5_0].
