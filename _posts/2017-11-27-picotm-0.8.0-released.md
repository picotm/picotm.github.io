Version 0.8.0 of picotm has been released today.

<!-- excerpt -->

Here's a list of new features and bug fixes.

 - New transactional data structures. Picotm now supports
   transactional lists, multisets, queues and stacks. Operation
   on these data structures provide concurrency control and
   error detection, and integrate with the transaction
   manager.
 - Unused functions and static variables can now be removed during
   the link step. This can greatly reduce the size of statically
   linked executables.
 - Bug fix: Failure to initialize a transaction will now be handled
   correctly by starting error recovery. (#139)
 - Bug fix: Irrevocability state is released exactly once during a roll back
   of the transaction. (#160)

picotm 0.8.0 is available for download on the GitHub
[release page][picotm_0_8_0].
