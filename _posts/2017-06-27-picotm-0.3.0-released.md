Version 0.3.0 of picotm has been released today.

<!-- excerpt -->

Here's a list of new features and bug fixes.

 * Relicensed source code under MIT license.

 * All transactional interfaces now report errors to the picotm
   framework. No error codes are returned to the execution phase
   on failure.

 * Fixed bug where closing a file descriptor did not work reliably.

 * Added module library with code for table and arrays. The table
   helpers were available before, the array helper have been added
   from module-internal helper code. All modules have been converted
   to the new helpers.

 * Switched to C11 atomic operations.

 * Internal cleanups.

picotm 0.3.0 is available for download on the GitHub
[release page][picotm_0_3_0].
