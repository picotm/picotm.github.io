This week I added some helpers for performance testing and visualization
in the [picotm-perf][github:picotm-perf] repository.

In my blog, I posted [an article][fwd] about the new benchmark script and
related tools. It goes into the details of the script, how communication is
done with the test utility, and how the script assembles a final PDF document
from the test results.
