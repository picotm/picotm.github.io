Version 0.2.0 of picotm has been released today.

<!-- excerpt -->

The new version features

 * Improved source code documentation. The documentation is part of
   the source code and can be extracted using 'make doc'. There's a
   tutorial for each module and the overall library.

 * Improved error handling. Errors used to be signalled by returning
   an error code from the failed function. This scheme has been replaced
   in many places by an additional output parameter of type
   `struct picotm_error`. The stored value signals an error, which type
   of error, which error, and maybe an additional error message.

 * Updated module interface. The module interface has been changed to
   use `struct picotm_error` for signalling errors to picotm. Two new
   call-back functions `apply()` and `undo()` allow for performing module-
   wide apply and undo during commit or rollback of a transaction.

picotm 0.2.0 is available for download on the GitHub
[release page][picotm_0_2_0].
