Version 0.6.0 of picotm has been released today.

<!-- excerpt -->

Here's a list of new features and bug fixes.

  - Added transactional sprintf() and sscanf() functions.
  - chdir_tx() now reports errors during roll-backs.
  - Added restart statistics. Call picotm_number_of_restarts() to
    retrieve the number of restarts performed by the local thread's
    last transaction. This functionality is helpful for benchmarking
    and performance analysis.
  - Added, reworked and cleaned up module tests. The tests result are
    returned in TAP format for easy integration into test harnesses.
  - Merge module tests into picotm package. Type `make check' to run
    all tests on your local machine.

picotm 0.6.0 is available for download on the GitHub
[release page][picotm_0_6_0].
