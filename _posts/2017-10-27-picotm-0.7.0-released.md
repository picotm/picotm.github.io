Version 0.7.0 of picotm has been released today.

<!-- excerpt -->

Here's a list of new features and bug fixes.

  - Added lock manager. The lock manager maintains R/W locks, resolves
    conflicts and schedules locks to transactions. Different scheduling
    strategies and irrevocability are supported.
  - The number of retries per transaction is now limited. This change
    results in more predictable transaction scheduling and higher
    throughput.
  - Transactional Memory module now uses picotm's R/W lock. This change
    integrates TM into the overall locking code
  - Individual test cases for each module. The test cases have been split
    up and moved to their respective module. Test infrstructure is shared
    among them.
  - Fix: `getcwd_tx()` now appends the correct command to the transaction
    log.
  - Fix: `open_tx()` now works correctly with relative paths

picotm 0.7.0 is available for download on the GitHub
