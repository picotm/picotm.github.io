The picotm project regularly releases stable versions of the software.
You can always find the latest version, or any previous one, on the
[Release][releases] page.

If you are interested in the latest snapshot, or want to develop picotm
itself, you'll have to download the git repository. On your Linux system,
enter

```
    git clone https://github.com/picotm/picotm.git
    cd picotm
```

to download the latest source code; including test cases. Follow the
instructions in the README file to build and configure the software.

If you have a bug fix or implemented a new feature for picotm, we'd
welcome a pull request.

[releases]: https://github.com/picotm/picotm/releases
