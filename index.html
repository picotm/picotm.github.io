<p>
Picotm is a system-level transaction manager. It provides transactional
semantics for low-level and operating-system functionality. It's flexible
and extensible to cover exactly your requirements. <strong>Error
handling</strong> and <strong>thread isolation</strong> are provided by
picotm, all you have to implement is the application logic.
</p>

<p>
Picotm is implemented in plain C and is well-suited for implementing
applications and firmware that is secure, reliable and thread-safe; yet
easy to develop. This makes picotm well-suited for
<strong>multi-threaded</strong> and <strong>fault-tolerant</strong>
software.
